# spaceAdventure
An arcade style game where the player dodges falling asteroids using the left and right arrow keys. The player can collect hearts and fuel on their journey to outer space. As time passes, the ship’s fuel depletes. Once out of fuel it’s game over! Another way to lose the game is to run out of hearts. Hearts are lost when asteroids hit the ship.
